# Rust benchmark baseline

**Recorded:** 2026-11-02 14:27 UTC
**Status:** All benchmark targets completed successfully. The optional live HTTP benchmark compiled and was skipped because BENCH_SERVICE_URL was unset.

This is the first persisted comparison baseline. Values are single-run microbenchmarks; compare only the same workloads, toolchain, and similar hardware/load. Timings are not CI thresholds. RSS is Linux process high-water RSS. Allocation measurements use a counting global allocator in each benchmark process.

## Environment

- WSL2 Linux x86_64, kernel 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2
- rustc 1.96.0 (ac68faa20 2025-05-25)
- 32 logical CPUs reported by nproc
- Optimized Cargo bench profile

## Comparison notes and limits

- This is the first persisted report; future runs should compare against these values. Earlier chat-only figures are not a stable baseline.
- Ledger memory includes fixtures, JSON and MessagePack buffers, and generic serde_json::Value decode outputs. It is not a direct measurement of production typed-ledger RSS.
- Fanout is in-process Tokio broadcast. Lag depends on ring capacity and consumer scheduling; the slow-consumer scenario intentionally overloads a 64-slot ring.
- The concurrent ledger benchmark models atomic file replacement but does not measure the production ledger mutex, filesystem durability, or power-loss behavior.
- Strategy timings measure evaluator speed, not trading returns, fill quality, or robustness across regimes.
- The HTTP benchmark is opt-in and was not run. No services were started or stopped.
- All five cargo bench --manifest-path invocations exited successfully. Crate test binaries also ran in bench mode; tests marked ignored remained ignored.

## Follow-up run (2026-11-02 14:28 UTC)

### USD-rate order-path lookup microbenchmark

| Workload | Result |
|---|---:|
| Merge + clone 6-currency cached/stream fixtures | 547.8 ns/op |
| Load premerged 6-currency snapshot | 15.5 ns/op |
| Snapshot lookup speedup | 35.3x |

This workload was run once earlier in the session (522.3 / 15.2 ns/op); the latest run differs by +4.9% / +2.0%, respectively. Treat this as normal single-run variation, not a regression. These figures isolate local rate-map preparation and atomic snapshot access; they do not include the order-cycle HTTP round trip or capacity/account work. No prior persisted result existed for this workload.
